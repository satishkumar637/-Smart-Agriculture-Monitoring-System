# -Smart-Agriculture-Monitoring-System
The Smart Agriculture Monitoring System is an intelligent solution designed to help farmers monitor and manage their farm's environmental conditions effectively. Agriculture relies heavily on precise control of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity to ensure optimal crop growth and yield


# Smart Agriculture Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project simulates a smart system to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels on a farm. It helps in making irrigation decisions by turning on the water pump automatically when soil moisture is low.

## Features
- Simulated sensor data for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- Alerts for low soil moisture and high temperature
- Automatic water pump activation simulation

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- random and time libraries for simulation

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run the script: `python smart_agriculture.py`
3. Observe the sensor readings and alerts printed in the console.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate real sensors using IoT devices.
- Add data logging and visualization.
- Develop a web/mobile user interface.
